## Installation

To create this website, the file had to be created from scratch and needed a proper structure and format to lay the code onto.  This was done, by using git bash application to create each file separately under a single folder.  To open the website, simply click the link below and establish which checkbox you would like to select for the final password.

## Usage

This website provides an easy way to choose a password that also is pleasant to look at.  The check boxes allow for the user to select what characters they would like to use in their password for their own sense of satisfaction.
